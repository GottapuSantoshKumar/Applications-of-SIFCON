# Applications-of-SIFCON
SIFCON has very good properties in terms of ductility, crack resistance, penetration and impact resistance when compared to other materials like SFRC.  The SIFCON is best suited to applications in the following areas.
	Pavement rehabilitation and pre cast concrete products.
	Overlays, bridge decks and protective revetments.
	Seismic and explosive resistant structures.
	Security concrete applications.(safety vaults, strong rooms)
	Refractory applications. (soak-pit covers, furnace lintels, saddle piers  )
	Sea protective works.
	Military applications such as anti-missile hangers, underground shelters.
	Aerospace launching platforms.
	Repair, rehabilitation and strengthening of structures.
	Concrete mega structures like offshore and long span structures, solar towers
